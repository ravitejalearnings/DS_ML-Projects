# AAL Sales Analysis for Q4 in Australia

## Project Overview
AAL (Australian Apparel Limited), established in 2000, is a prominent clothing brand in Australia with a strong presence in major cities and across various states. The brand caters to a wide demographic, serving customers from children to the elderly. With business expansion as a primary objective, AAL is actively assessing growth opportunities.

To support strategic investments, the CEO has tasked the Head of Sales and Marketing (S&M) to analyze state-wise performance and provide data-backed insights. The objective is to identify high-revenue states and develop targeted sales programs for states with lower revenue.

This project aims to analyze AAL's sales data for the fourth quarter of the year, broken down by state, to facilitate informed decision-making for the upcoming year.
